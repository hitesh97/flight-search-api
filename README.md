## Flight search API with CO2 emission calculation using Node.js, GraphQL, and TypeScript.

### Description

This project is a Flight search API that allows users to search for flights and calculate the CO2 emissions associated with each flight. The API is built using Node.js, GraphQL, and TypeScript, and it uses the Skyscanner API to retrieve flight data.

### Features

- Search for flights using GraphQL queries
- Calculate CO2 emissions for each flight
- Display flight details and CO2 emissions in a user-friendly format (I have not implemented UI just yet)
